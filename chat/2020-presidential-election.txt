>>> USER:
You are using RStudio to conduct R programming tasks in POSIT remote server with preloaded tidyverse package. If the task is programming related, the programming style should follow tidyverse style as closely as possible, i.e. if certain task can be done in both base R and tidyverse, use tidyverse. The package `tidyverse` is already loaded. Any provided code that uses its functions will work -- no need to `library` it again. `tidyverse` is a collection of packages designed for data science. It includes `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, `forcats`, and `haven`. When there is possibility to use chain operator, always use `|>` instead of `%>%`.

If the code uses `filter()` from `dplyr` package, ALWAYS write `dplyr::filter()` instead of just `filter()`.

When codes are involved with labels or names that are not conventional (i.e using only a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and `_`), the labels or names should be enclosed in backticks.

If the task mentions an object but does not give the content of the object, assume that the object is already in the global environment, and don't create an example of that object in the code.

If I ask you to rename a data frame's variables but provide no current variable names, ask me what are they. Then rename them to concise names in snake case.

If I ask you to parse a variable into a factor or ordered factor without mentioning its levels, ask me "what are the levels of the factor? or ignore this question", and also give me the command of using `unique()` to find the levels. If I provide the levels, then parse the variable into a factor with the specified levels.

When parse date or date time, always use `lubridate` package's parsing function rather than using `as.Date`. To parse monthly data, use `ym` function. To parse quarterly data, use `yq` function. If the date is Taiwan date, be aware the year is not a western year unless you take out `yyyy` part and add 1911 to it. If time zone of a date time string is given, use `tz` argument in date parsing function to set the time zone -- not using `with_tz`. For time, use `hms` to parse. But if the value before parsing is not in "hh:mm:ss" format, change it to that format before parsing.

String. Always use `stringr` package to deal with string. For pattern regarding "may or may not be there", if it is about one character, say "X may or may not be there", use "X?"; if it is about a phrase "XXX may or may not be there" use "(XXX)?". When applying a function from `stringr` package to a variable, if the variable is not a character type, convert it to character type first.

Throughout the conversation, if certain packages are imported through `library()` function, such packages should not be imported again in the following code answers.

When my task requires more details to be clear, ask me for more details. If the task is too broad, help me narrow it down by listing directions that I can pursue.

>>> ASSISTANT:
Understood! I'm ready to assist with R programming tasks using the tidyverse style and the guidelines you've provided. Please let me know what specific task you'd like help with, and I'll provide the appropriate code and instructions.

  1. 由"候選人"創造 "政黨" 變數，其中 "候選人" 變數的值為 "(1)\n宋楚瑜\n余湘"則 "政黨" 變數的值為 "親民黨"； "候選人" 變數的值為 "(2)\n韓國瑜\n張善政"則 "政黨" 變數的值為 "國民黨"，其他為"民進黨"。  
  2. 計算各政黨在各縣市的得票率。

>>> ASSISTANT:
To accomplish your tasks, we will follow these steps:

1. Create a new variable `政黨` based on the values in the `候選人` variable.
2. Calculate the 得票率 for each party in each district (行政區別).

Here's how you can do this using the `dplyr` package from the tidyverse:

```r
presidential_election <- presidential_election |>
  dplyr::mutate(`政黨` = dplyr::case_when(
    `候選人` == "(1)\n宋楚瑜\n余湘" ~ "親民黨",
    `候選人` == "(2)\n韓國瑜\n張善政" ~ "國民黨",
    TRUE ~ "民進黨"
  ))

# Calculate 得票率 for each party in each district
result <- presidential_election |>
  dplyr::group_by(`行政區別`, `政黨`) |>
  dplyr::summarise(`得票率` = sum(`得票數`) / sum(`有效票數`) * 100, .groups = 'drop')

# View the result
print(result)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`mutate` and `case_when`**: We create a new variable `政黨` using `mutate` and assign values based on conditions in the `候選人` variable.
2. **`group_by` and `summarise`**: We group by `行政區別` and `政黨`, calculate the `得票率` (which is the total votes divided by the total valid votes, multiplied by 100), and drop the grouping afterward.

Let me know if you need any further adjustments or additional details on this code!

>>> USER:
For functions from dplyr package that use `.groups = 'drop'` option, instead of using it,  remove it and use `ungroup()`.

>>> ASSISTANT:
Got it! Let's adjust the code to use `ungroup()` instead of specifying `.groups = 'drop'` in the `summarise()` function. Here’s the modified code:

```r
presidential_election <- presidential_election |>
  dplyr::mutate(`政黨` = dplyr::case_when(
    `候選人` == "(1)\n宋楚瑜\n余湘" ~ "親民黨",
    `候選人` == "(2)\n韓國瑜\n張善政" ~ "國民黨",
    TRUE ~ "民進黨"
  ))

# Calculate 得票率 for each party in each district
result <- presidential_election |>
  dplyr::group_by(`行政區別`, `政黨`) |>
  dplyr::summarise(`得票率` = sum(`得票數`) / sum(`有效票數`) * 100) |>
  dplyr::ungroup()

# View the result
print(result)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- Removed the `.groups = 'drop'` option from the `summarise()` function and added `ungroup()` afterward to ensure that the result is no longer grouped.

glimpse(result[1:2,])
Rows: 2

$ 行政區別 <chr> "南投縣", "南投縣"
$ 政黨     <chr> "國民黨", "民進黨"
$ 得票率   <dbl> 44.72342, 50.82567
result pivot成寛的，得票率為值，政黨為欄位。

>>> ASSISTANT:
To pivot the `result` data frame to a wide format, where `政黨` becomes the column names and `得票率` becomes the values, we can use the `pivot_wider()` function from the `tidyr` package, which is part of the tidyverse. Here’s how you can do it:

```r
result_wide <- result |>
  tidyr::pivot_wider(
    names_from = `政黨`,
    values_from = `得票率`,
    values_fill = list(`得票率` = NA)  # Fill with NA for any missing values
  )

# View the result
print(result_wide)
```

### Explanation:
- **`pivot_wider()`**: This function reshapes the data from a long format to a wide format.
  - `names_from = `政黨`: This argument specifies that the unique values from the `政黨` column will be used as new column names.
  - `values_from = `得票率``: This argument dictates that the values in the new columns will come from the `得票率` column.
  - `values_fill`: It specifies how to fill in the new cells created in the wide format. In this case, we are filling any missing values with `NA`.

Let me know if you need further adjustments or additional help!

>>> USER:
glimpse(result_wide[1:2,])

$ 行政區別 <chr> "南投縣", "嘉義市"
$ 國民黨   <dbl> 44.72342, 34.79022
$ 民進黨   <dbl> 50.82567, 61.37395
$ 親民黨   <dbl> 4.450915, 3.835833

將result_wide pivot成長的，$ 國民黨 到 $ 親民黨 欄位收成"政黨"欄位值，而原先欄位的值則變成"得票率"欄位值。

>>> ASSISTANT:
To pivot the `result_wide` data frame back to a long format where the party names (`國民黨`, `民進黨`, `親民黨`) are converted into a single `政黨` column and their corresponding values in a `得票率` column, we can use the `pivot_longer()` function from the `tidyr` package. Here’s how to do this:

```r
result_long <- result_wide |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = c(`國民黨`, `民進黨`, `親民黨`),
    names_to = `政黨`,
    values_to = `得票率`
  )

# View the result
print(result_long)
```

### Explanation:
- **`pivot_longer()`**: This function reshapes the data from a wide format back to a long format.
  - `cols = c(`國民黨`, `民進黨`, `親民黨`)`: This argument specifies which columns to collapse into a single key column (`政黨`).
  - `names_to = `政黨``: This argument indicates that the names of the previously wide columns become the values in the new `政黨` column.
  - `values_to = `得票率``: This argument signifies that the values from the selected columns should be assigned to the new `得票率` column.

Let me know if you have any further questions or need any more help!

>>> USER:
Error: object '政黨' not found

>>> ASSISTANT:
The error suggests that `政黨` might not be recognized as a proper variable in the `pivot_longer()` function. This can happen if the variable names are not correctly enclosed in backticks when using special characters or non-standard names.

Let’s correctly reference the column names in backticks. Please try the following code:

```r
result_long <- result_wide |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = c(`國民黨`, `民進黨`, `親民黨`),
    names_to = `政黨`,
    values_to = `得票率`
  )

# View the result
print(result_long)
```

### Explanation:
- Ensure that `cols`, `names_to`, and `values_to` have the correct syntax with backticks surrounding each variable when they contain special characters.

If the column names still aren't recognized, you could also try using the column indices or ensure that `result_wide` contains those specific columns by checking its structure with `glimpse(result_wide)`. 

Let me know if this resolves the issue!

>>> USER:
When use `tidyr::pivot_longer()` function, `names_to` and `values_to` argument values should be a string.

>>> ASSISTANT:
You're correct! The `names_to` and `values_to` arguments in the `pivot_longer()` function should indeed be provided as strings, not as variable names.

Here’s the corrected code:

```r
result_long <- result_wide |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = c(`國民黨`, `民進黨`, `親民黨`),
    names_to = "政黨",
    values_to = "得票率"
  )

# View the result
print(result_long)
```

### Changes Made:
- Replaced the backticks around `政黨` and `得票率` with strings (double quotes).

Now, this code should correctly pivot `result_wide` back to a long format with the `政黨` and `得票率` columns. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
